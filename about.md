## About This Garden

This digital garden is built with Jekyll and styled to feel like Obsidian - a modern, minimal note-taking experience for the web.

### Philosophy

<div class="callout">
<div class="callout-title">Learn in Public</div>
This garden embraces imperfection. Notes here range from rough seedlings to polished evergreen content.
</div>

The idea is simple: capture thoughts as they come, connect them over time, and let knowledge compound. Not everything needs to be a finished blog post.

### How It's Built

This site uses:

- **Jekyll** - A static site generator that GitHub Pages supports natively
- **Markdown** - Plain text files that are easy to write and version control
- **Custom CSS** - A hand-crafted theme inspired by Obsidian's aesthetic
- **GitHub Pages** - Free hosting with automatic deployment

### Note Stages

Notes in this garden follow a growth metaphor:

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🌱 Seedling | Just planted, rough ideas |
| 🌿 Growing | Being actively developed |
| 🌳 Evergreen | Mature, well-developed notes |

### Connect
