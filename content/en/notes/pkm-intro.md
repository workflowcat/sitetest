Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) is the practice of collecting, organizing, and connecting information in a way that's useful to your future self.

## Why PKM Matters

We consume more information than ever before, but most of it gets lost. A good PKM system helps you:

- **Capture** ideas as they come
- **Connect** concepts from different domains
- **Find** knowledge when you need it
- **Create** new ideas from existing ones

## Core Principles

### 1. Write Everything Down

Don't rely on memory. Write things down immediately.

> [!quote] David Allen
> "Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them."

### 2. Link Freely

Magic happens when ideas connect. Every note should link to related concepts.

### 3. Write for Your Future Self

Assume you'll forget the context. Make notes understandable on their own.
