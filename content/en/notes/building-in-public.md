🌿 *Growing — This note is actively developing*

Building in public is the practice of openly sharing your work, process, and knowledge while creating.

## Why Build in Public?

### Accountability

When others can see your progress, you're more likely to follow through.

### Feedback

Early and frequent feedback helps build better things.

### Community

You attract like-minded people interested in your journey.

### Documentation

Your public trail becomes documentation for your future self.

## What to Share

- **Progress updates** — What you're working on
- **Discoveries** — What you learned or understood
- **Struggles** — Where you're stuck (others can help!)
- **Wins** — Celebrate milestones, however small

## What to Keep Private

Not everything belongs in public:

- Personal or sensitive information
- Work under NDA
- Ideas not yet ready for discussion

## This Digital Garden

This site itself is an exercise in building publicly:

> [!abstract] Meta
> You're reading a note about building in public... on a site being built publicly. How recursive!

### The Journey

1. Started with a simple idea
2. Chose [[en/about|Quartz]] for GitHub Pages
3. Publish early, iterate often

## Tips for Getting Started

1. **Start small** — One tweet, one short post
2. **Be consistent** — Regular updates beat viral posts
3. **Be authentic** — Share real struggles, not just wins
4. **Engage** — Reply to comments, thank people
