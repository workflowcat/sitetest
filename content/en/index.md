This is my digital garden — a place for thoughts, ideas, and notes that grow and evolve over time.

> [!info] What is a digital garden?
> A digital garden is a collection of interconnected notes and ideas. Unlike a blog, there's no chronological order. Notes evolve, get updated, and connect to each other.
