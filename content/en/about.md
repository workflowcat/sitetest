## About This Site

This is a personal knowledge base in the format of a "digital garden" — a place where notes grow and evolve over time.

> [!tip] Learning in Public
> This garden embraces imperfection. Notes here range from raw ideas to fully developed content.

## Philosophy

The idea is simple: capture thoughts as they come, connect them over time, and let knowledge accumulate. Not everything needs to be a finished article.

### Why Not a Blog?

| Blog | Digital Garden |
|------|----------------|
| Chronological order | Connections between notes |
| Finished articles | Evolving ideas |
| Publish once | Continuous updates |
| One author → readers | Explore together |

## Note Stages

Notes here have different stages of maturity:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🌱 Seedling | Just planted, raw ideas |
| 🌿 Growing | Actively developing |
| 🌳 Evergreen | Mature, well-developed note |

## How It's Built

> [!note] Technologies
> - **Quartz** — static generator for digital gardens
> - **GitHub Pages** — free hosting
> - **Markdown** — plain text for writing
> - **Obsidian-style** — wikilinks, callouts, graph view

## Navigation

### Sidebar

On the left you'll find file tree navigation — just like in Obsidian.

### Search

Press `⌘K` (or `Ctrl+K`) for quick note search.

### Graph

At the bottom of each page is a local graph of connections. On the home page — a global graph.

### Theme

Click the sun/moon icon to switch between dark and light themes.
