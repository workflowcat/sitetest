title: Building in Public
---

🌿 *Growing - This note is being actively developed*

Building in public means sharing your work, process, and learnings openly as you create.

## Why Build in Public?

### Accountability
When others can see your progress, you're more likely to follow through.

### Feedback
Early and frequent feedback helps you build better things.

### Community
You attract like-minded people interested in your journey.

### Documentation
Your public trail becomes documentation for your future self.

## What to Share

- **Progress updates** - What you're working on
- **Learnings** - What you discovered or figured out
- **Struggles** - Where you're stuck (others may help!)
- **Wins** - Celebrate milestones, however small

## What to Keep Private

Not everything belongs in public:

- Personal or sensitive information
- Work under NDA
- Ideas you're not ready to discuss
- Content that could harm others

## This Digital Garden

This site itself is an exercise in building in public:

<div class="callout">
<div class="callout-title">Meta</div>
You're reading a note about building in public... on a site that's being built in public. How recursive!

### The Journey

1. Started with a simple idea
2. Chose Jekyll for GitHub Pages integration
3. Designed an Obsidian-inspired theme
4. Published early, iterate often

## Tips for Getting Started

1. **Start small** - One tweet, one short post
2. **Be consistent** - Regular updates beat viral posts
3. **Be authentic** - Share real struggles, not just wins
4. **Engage** - Reply to comments, thank people
