title: Introduction to Personal Knowledge Management

🌱 *Seedling - This note is just getting started*

Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) is the practice of collecting, organizing, and connecting information in a way that's useful for your future self.

## Why PKM Matters

We consume more information than ever before, but most of it slips away. A good PKM system helps you:

- **Capture** ideas when they strike
- **Connect** concepts across domains
- **Retrieve** knowledge when you need it
- **Create** new ideas from existing ones

## Core Principles

### 1. Capture Everything

Don't rely on memory. Write things down immediately.

> "Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them." — David Allen

### 2. Link Liberally

The magic happens when ideas connect. Every note should link to related concepts.

### 3. Write for Your Future Self

Assume you'll forget context. Make notes understandable on their own.
