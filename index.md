title: Welcome to My Digital Garden
---

This is a minimal, Obsidian-inspired digital garden for capturing ideas, notes, and knowledge.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a collection of evolving notes, ideas, and thoughts that grow over time. Unlike a traditional blog with polished posts, a digital garden embraces the messiness of learning in public.

> "A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organized by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory."
